  <div class="content" id="3"><h2>GDPSFH V3.6 IS HERE! (Improved GDPS update) <span class="subtext">by Rya [12th Jun 2024]</span></h2>Time for a change! ...a pretty significant one in fact! We now officially support MegaSa1nt's GDPS core and it is now the default for newly created GDPSs.
We added a migration button (that took way too long to make) which will <em>attempt</em> to migrate your GDPS to the new core. So far this feature is stable from my testing... shoutouts to the several people adding +300mb of content to my test-GDPS.
Due to how much effort it took to get THAT working, I'll be postponing support for 2.206. It should be out by next week though.
<strong>I recommend migrating as it includes a few fixes and improves stability for existing GDPSs.</strong></div><br><div class="content" id="2"><h2>Never say &quot;soon&quot; too soon <span class="subtext">by Rya [23rd Feb 2024]</span></h2>I said it'd come in early 2024 and I was right!! ...i hope. Anyway, <strong>2.2 is now officially supported!</strong> All new GDPSs are 2.2-ready and even have a pre-configured database for easier setup. <strong>Important note: For older GDPSs, you will have to wait for the version selector to come out!!!</strong> Additionally, we have been working on a new (and probably first ever) feature: A custom SFX server! You can join our Discord Server and upload sound effects via our bot. Best of all: Our SFX server can be used on any GDPS, even outside of GDPSFH. Replace the link in <code>getCustomContentURL.php</code> with <code>https://sfx.fhgdps.com</code>.</div><br><div class="content" id="1"><h2>GDPS Creation back, now with a new frontpage! <span class="subtext">by Rya [12th Dec 2023]</span></h2>I am glad to announce that we now have a <em>neat-looking</em> frontpage for GDPSFH! I hope that I can later make the panel look be consistent with the frontpage.
Additionally, I now have done a little cleanup and removed all GDPSs that were broken or completely unused (totalling over 1500 GDPSs). That means that the wait for GDPS Creation to work again is now over!! This should stay up even once 2.2 releases (however a version selector Will not be available immediately).
Feel free to submit suggestions in our Discord server, I'm waiting for your feedback!</div><br><script>(function(){function c(){var b=a.contentDocument||a.contentWindow.document;if(b){var d=b.createElement('script');d.innerHTML="window.__CF$cv$params={r:'8d6697cee8827ce0',t:'MTcyOTU2OTc1OS4wMDAwMDA='};var a=document.createElement('script');a.nonce='';a.src='/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(a);";b.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(d)}}if(document.body){var a=document.createElement('iframe');a.height=1;a.width=1;a.style.position='absolute';a.style.top=0;a.style.left=0;a.style.border='none';a.style.visibility='hidden';document.body.appendChild(a);if('loading'!==document.readyState)c();else if(window.addEventListener)document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',c);else{var e=document.onreadystatechange||function(){};document.onreadystatechange=function(b){e(b);'loading'!==document.readyState&&(document.onreadystatechange=e,c())}}}})();</script>
